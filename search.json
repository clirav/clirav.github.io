    "text": "Education\nIn 2005, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. In 2010, I earned my Master of Science in Counseling Psychology. Currently, I am earning a PhD in Public and Nonprofit Management.\n\n\nWorking Experience\nAfter earning my bachelor degree, I taught English in Trujillo, Peru, for 10 months and in the process, became conversational in Spanish. I entered my master program soon afterwards and had a 10-year career in social work and substance abuse treatment. In 2014, inspired by my clients, I founded Embracing Diversity, Inc, a 501(c)3 registered in Florida and in Mississippi. Embracing Diversity was founded to assist immigrants as they acclimate to their new environment. In operating this organization, I realized the importance of cross-sectoral collaborations. I also realized that my education did not incorporate the impact public policy or economics has on my clients. So, I began the PhD program."

We look at race, socioeconomic status, and gender. We also apply these lenses to various sectors. At the end, we provide insight for human resource management.\n\n\nConceptual Paper\nCognitive Dissonance in Decision-making During Crisis\nIn this conceptual paper, I investigate the impact of cognitive dissonance on equitable decision-making during crisis. Cognitive dissonance, according to the seminal literature, is the psychological discomfort experienced when plans or beliefs are countered by newly discovered facts. A person must then decide how to rectify this dissonance by either changing their previous belief or rationalizing a dismissal of the new information. Dissonance, though heavily studied in psychology, has not been thoroughly researched in public administration. In the public sector, decisions are very important because they heavily impact the lives of the public. Therefore, if cognitive dissonance impacts equitable decision-making, then this angle needs to be further studied. Viewing equity as the foundational belief and as a pillar of our field, I look at case studies in which public administrators made decisions during crisis, and I examine whether dissonance played a role in their decision-making."
