Currently, I am earning a PhD in Public and Nonprofit Management.\n\n\nWorking Experience\nAfter earning my bachelor degree, I taught English in Trujillo, Peru, for 10 months and in the process, became conversational in Spanish. I entered my master program soon afterwards and had a 10-year career in social work and substance abuse treatment. In 2014, inspired by my clients, I founded Embracing Diversity, Inc, a 501(c)3 registered in Florida and in Mississippi. Embracing Diversity was founded to assist immigrants as they acclimate to their new environment. In operating this organization, I realized the importance of cross-sectoral collaborations. I also realized that my education did not incorporate the impact public policy or economics has on my clients. So, I began the PhD program.\nLinkedIn\nEmbracing Diversity, Inc."
